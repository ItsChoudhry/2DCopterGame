# 2DCopterGame

I made this 2d helicopter escape game to learn game engines. The code is quite rushed and very C like.

## dependencies
```
cmake 3.7
SDL2 2.0.9-1
SDL2_image 2.0.5-1
SDL2_ttf 2.0.15-1
Lua 5.3
```

## To Compile To Game

Assuming you have all the dependencies:

#From root of project dir
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run the game
After compiling the game:
```
./2DCopterGame
```
